# License Plate Recognition using TensorFlow Object Detection API

This project aims to recognize license plates using TensorFlow and the TensorFlow Object Detection API. Pre-trained models from the TensorFlow Model Garden have been utilized and fine-tuned to detect license plates on a Kaggle dataset. Subsequently, EasyOCR library is employed to recognize characters on the license plate.

## Requirements
- TensorFlow 2.15
- [TensorFlow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2.md)
- Python 3.9
- EasyOCR
- Ubuntu (or compatible operating system)

## Acknowledgements
This project utilizes pre-trained models from the TensorFlow Model Garden and leverages the EasyOCR library for character recognition.
